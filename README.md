## Description:
A simple TCP Instant Messaging app that allows for real time communication using TCP.

Start up `ezTCPapp.py`, enter your name, a target IP address, a target port (ex. 5005), 
and a local port (ex. 5005). Then do the same on the target computer and you're ready 
to start chatting! Once you get the `CONNECTED` message, you can start typing and use 
enter to send. To stop the connection hit enter three times.

Make sure to have both `ezTCPapp.py` and `ezTCPlib.py` downloaded and in the same 
directory.

It is best to start the app from commandline rather than in Python's IDLE.

There are Python 2 and Python 3 versions of the program. For the Python 2 version 
go to src-python2, for the Python 3 version go to src-python3.

##Example:
Let's say that Bob at IP address 132.874.0.123 wants to talk to Kate at IP address 
253.324.0.324. Bob starts up `./ezTCPapp.py` and types the following:

`Enter your first name:` Bob

`Enter target IP address:` 253.324.0.324

`Enter target port:` 5005

`Enter local port:` 5003

`Waiting for remote connection...`

Now on Kate's end, she starts `./ezTCPapp.py` and types the following:

`Enter your first name:` Kate

`Enter target IP address:` 132.874.0.123

`Enter target port:` 5003

`Enter local port:` 5005

`Waiting for remote connection...`

`CONNECTED`

Now just start typing and hit enter! Pressing enter three times quits the shell.
